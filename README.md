## Project Breakdown

### What is League of Legends?

League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
<br>
In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

### Custom Games in League

Customs are games that allow you to play against and/or alongside chosen players and/or bots. 
<br>

### The Problem

A very common problem when we got ten people together to play a custom league of legend game was how to divide the teams. We had to use randomization sites like random.org to create the teams in a fair way. Another problem was when random.org generation would end up with a team that had almost or all of the best players. Also, the programs we were using didn't have the ability to randomize the roles to play.


<br>

## The Solution

Our application receives the list of the ten players, to which you can specify those who are higher rank in order to make a fair balancing. Also, the platform uses the leagueofgraphs.com website to extract the best champions for each role in order to provide a viable random champion for each player.
